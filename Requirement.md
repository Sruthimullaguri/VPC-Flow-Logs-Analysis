# Assignment 15: VPC Flow Logs Analysis with Athena
## Task:
Analyze VPC traffic using Flow Logs and Athena.
## What to Do:
●    Create VPC with public and private subnets
●    Launch 2 EC2 instances (one in each subnet)
●    Enable VPC Flow Logs → S3 bucket (Parquet format)
●    Generate traffic:
●    SSH to public instance
●    Ping between instances
●    Wget external websites
●    Attempt connection to blocked port
●    Create Athena table for Flow Logs
●    Write SQL queries to find:
●    Top 10 source IPs by traffic volume
●    All REJECT actions
●    Traffic between specific IPs
●    Connections to port 22
●    Traffic by protocol (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
●    Create saved queries for common patterns
●    Calculate cost of data processed
## Success Criteria:
●    Flow logs appear in S3 within 10 minutes
●    Athena queries return accurate results
●    Can identify security events from logs
